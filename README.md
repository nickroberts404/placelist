## PlaceList
An app for creating and sharing "playlists" of places, created to practice user authentication and GraphQL! (I know, the name sounds more lazy than punny) 

It uses Google's Places API for location data and autosuggest, Passport's Facebook strategy for login, Apollo packages for working with the GraphQL server, and MongoDB Atlas for data persistence.
